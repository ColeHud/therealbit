**Why we created it:** 
We wanted to create a fun application for users to learn more about the magical currency we know as bitcoin. By playing this game, users are required to have or create a bitcoin wallet, thus beginning their journey. With a simple game which only costs a quarter, this game really goes back in time, but with a chance at a more lucrative reward.

**How to play:**

The game controls are relatively esay. 
1. Start the game
2. Press Play (Enter a quarter)
3. Press on the left and right side of the screen to guide your character
4. Catching dollars will give you 1 point, catching bitcoins will give you 5 points. Each form of currency that is missed results in a loss of a life. 
5. Restart and play again!
